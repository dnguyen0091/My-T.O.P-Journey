    <h1>This is the top of the header hierarchy known as h1</h1>
    <!-- <p>This is a paragraph</p> -->
    <h2>This is the second level of the header hierarchy known as h2</h2>
    <h3>This is the third level of the header hierarchy known as h3</h3>
    <h4>This is the fourth level of the header hierarchy known as h4</h4>
    <h5>This is the fifth level of the header hierarchy known as h5</h5>
    <h6>This is the sixth level of the header hierarchy known as h6</h6>

    <p>The hierarchy only accepts levels <strong>1-6</strong>, so don't try other levels or you will have an error</p>

    <p>The use of  <em>"strong"</em> is used to make the string within the wrapper bold
    and the use of <em><strong>"em"</strong></em> is used to make the string within the wrapper italic</p>
