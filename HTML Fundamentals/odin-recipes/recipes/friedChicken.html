    <p>A crispy batch of fried chicken is a staple in a southern household. The crisp and crunchy outside paired with the juicy white meat in chicken wings provides a flavourful experience.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4lbs of chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup of buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>2 qts of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Cut up chicken pieces</p></li>
        <li><p>In another bowl. Season flour with paprika,salt, and pepper</p></li>
        <li><p>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</p></li>
        <li><p>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</p></li>
        <li><p>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</p></li>
        <li><p>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</p></li>
